"One of the major problems with this report is the categorization of the project. For example, Section 8 (3)(vii) of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, stipulates that if more than 50 trees need to be cut for any infrastructure purpose, permission can only be issued after a public consultation. Officials have figured out a way to avoid this situation for sometime – they issue work orders to cut trees in bunches of 49 or lesser. To cut fewer than 50 trees, only permission from the BBMP Tree Officer is needed, and nothing more.
Ipso facto, it's easy to circumvent categorization of projects in order to avoid public consultation.
The second major pitfall is the lack of transparency of public consultations. Public consultations are posted in some esoteric corner of the internet and is usually prefunctory. We as a nation lack a cohesive public consultation space and hence most such consultations proceed with paltry inputs after they've been suspended in the void for a few days. Unless we solve the issue of proper public consulation, we'll be at the mercy of serendipity. An easy solution to this would be to post evey public consultation on a public forum like Twitter and to take strict action against any project which doesn't have a corresponding post on the twitter handle.
If we can tackle the subversion of categorization and lack of a good space for public consultation. We can ensure that such Environmental Impact Assessments have legs on which they can stand upon.",28,1,23
"There are many problems with this draft on the environmental and democratic front. 
Firstly, this draft proposes to shorten public hearings and exempt some large industries from public hearings itself- includes irrigation, dam works, etc. Marginalised communities who depend on the land for all their needs will can technically lose it without being consulted for 'strategic projects'. The term strategic projects could be anything- it is not clearly defined at all! Either this, or there is lesser time for mobilisation and organised protest because of the shortening of the public hearing period. 
Then the fait accompli issues come in with the post-facto clearance. The validity for clearances for certain industries have increased- newer installations to projects can be done at much more ease with less consultation because of the clearances. The compliance report has reduced annually instead of bieneally- which causes all the more damage and lesser need for checkups! This pandemic should have been a wake up call to strengthen the environment regulations not dilute it further.
This draft should definitely be withdrawn and released at a more suitable date when people are not grappling with a global pandemic. When it is released, it should be done with adequate time for the public hearing period. There should be more transparency regarding the response people give during this period and why it has been implemented or not implemented in the final report.",19,0,18

"Dear Mr. Mishra This is with reference to the draft EIA notification 2020 which was uploaded on the environment ministry's website om 12/03/2020. I raise my strong objection to the following points presented in the draft notification and request you to withdraw these notifications as it would have strong negative consequences for ecology and biodiversity of the country. 1. Point 7 on page 9 gave government total discretion on approving any kind of project which could very well be used by strong companies or mafia to create pressure on the government. 2. The list of exemptions mentioned in page 19 of the draft under the head public consultation gives exemption to virtually every project, for example the provision for relaxation given to companies for development in area with 100km aerial distance from LAC covers almost all of the north eastern states which is rich in biodiversity and these provision can cause serious damage to the environment. Not following Environment norms resulted in fire at the Baghjan well and these types of incidents will only rise if proper checks and measure isn't established. Roads are however important in development of northeastern states and i appreciate the initiative taken by government in this regard. 3. The concept of post facto clearence would give many industries a bypass to follow environment safety measures by paying a small fee and would act like a big blockage in the road towards sustainable development. This is also in direct contradiction to the order of supreme court dated 1st April 2020 stating POST FACTO CLEARENCE ARE CONTRARY TO LAW. 4. The inability of general public to register any kind if complaints and giving that power to only government and those that are currently involved in breaking the law would mean skipping an important step in keeping check and measures and would serve nothing but dire consequences for the environment and the ecology. 5. I raise strong objection to point 7 on page 9 which states that ""no information will be made public in regards to the decisions by the appraisal committee"" clearly is in violation to our right to information and a serious threat to the democratic fabric of our government. It is therefore my earnest request to make changes to the above mentioned provisions and reintroduce the draft after making necessary changes in the draft.",1,0,6

"""The EIA process was historically devised to take into account the needs of communities, and should be a meticulously planned, elaborate process to ascertain the environmental viability of a project. The entire process is reduced to a series of quick steps that is being fulfilled by cutting corners. This entire mechanism simply does not document the voices of communities that will be directly affected by proposed development projects. The few instances it does are few and far in between. The resounding cry of experts in the field is that this is entirely driven by the dubious “ease of doing business” strategy. Culturally also, we are at an unfortunate juncture where commercial infrastructure gains precedence over natural infrastructure (nature), i.e airports and highways are valued more in comparison to mangroves and ecologically sensitive areas that are part of our culture and knowledge heritage. The approach to “development” should be bottom-up and there is an urgent need to create an enabling democratic environment that allows people to put forth their views without the fear of backlash. ""

"The draft notification is a watered-down version of the EIA 2006 notification and has failed to:
1. Incorporate the realities of the present and the future by not including industries such as battery manufacturing, manufacture of solar panels, and other components that are the backbone of the booming renewable energy sector.
2. Resolve the crisis of improper e-waste management, which has pernicious effects on natural ecosystems and public health by choosing not to regulate e-waste processing in India.
3. Include Geoengineering, which is deliberate and large-scale manipulation of Earth’s natural processes, and is a big contributor to the climate crisis. 
4. Reduce the list of projects that are either exempt from environmental clearance or do not need public consultation before getting environmental clearance;
a) Linear infrastructure projects like highway expansions have been exempted from getting prior environmental clearance even though there is clear evidence of the threat of fragmentation of wildlife habitats and the emergence of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19
b) Projects that promote continued fossil fuel dependence like coal bed methane extraction, onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling, shale gas exploration, and extraction are placed in the exempt category, even though they exert a huge toll on the environment and are not green.
The draft notification, by placing the district magistrate (DM) as the chairman of the District Environment Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA) and District Environmental Assessment Committee (DEAC), creates a serious dilemma. How can the environment be guarded if the same person who grants approval to industries as DM is supposed to review it as chairman of DEIAA/DEAC? The move to do away with individual environmental clearances for projects within industrial complexes will lead to poor compliance and adherence to environmental standards by the respective industries within the industrial complex. Further, there is no scope of fixing individual accountability under such circumstances meaning environmental violations are more likely than ever to slip under the radar leading to widespread environmental degradation.
The 2020 draft notification only looks to serve the interests of the business community as it shortens the timelines for getting environmental clearances, increases the validity of mining and riverbed related projects, does away with clearance requirements for expansion projects and has expanded the exclusion list under which projects are exempted from getting environmental clearances. 
In recent months/years, we have observed the effects of a weak environmental policy. Mumbai's Aarey forest was cleared to build a metro shed despite massive protests. Vizag's LG Polymers caused a gas leak on 7th May. Assam's Baghjan gas leak is another recent example. In the view of current situation where we faced natural calamities like cyclones due to climate change, locust attacks, covid 19 pandemic this year and many more natural and man made calamities in the past few years, we should make the EIA amendments even stronger to protect and preserve our natural resources and use them sustainably instead of diluting it and making it easier for industries to get clearance. Moreover, we should have notifications for EIA public comments on projects advertised on national television and national newspapers for people who do not have internet access or the knowledge to navigate through online portals. Majority of our rural/agrarian population who would be more likely be affected by many industrial projects don't even know how to access the online portals. Before making provisions online for such important legislations, we should have adequate training for the public to use these portals efficiently.

"At the outset, I suggest this EIA Notification be postponed for sometime at least. This is because it was prepared prior to the outbreak of COVID19. Circumstances as well as the very concepts of environment have drastically changed ever since this Corona virus has struck the entire world. It has proved the necessity for every country to take environment in a global scale rather than in a local scale. Better the experts who have drafted this Notification sit together and decide whether there are any changes in EIA Notification required in light of these rather developments. on global scle.
We may have to give more priority to safeguard our ecology, our habitat and it may also require much more stringent action against the defaulters. Certain regulations we may have to focus on a global scale.
Anther point I want to put forward on EIA Notification is:
The major issue which this EIA Notification should consider is how we are going to tackle population growth vs insdustrial development. Though an industry might have been established in the out skirts of an urban environment today, soon colonies are being developed around it and naturally they become victims of  disasters in the industry as it happened in many cases in recent times. It may be essential to define much more stringent norms for the buffer space which the industry should allot all around its main establishment. 
It may also be a good idea if the government puts a locking period on the continuation of the industry, based on the populaton around the industry. The industry should shift its location  when the populaton around it reaches a critical level. This condition should be stipulated at the time of giving the first clearance for the consent for establishment of the industry.

"One of the major problems with this report is the categorization of the project. For example, Section 8 (3)(vii) of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, stipulates that if more than 50 trees need to be cut for any infrastructure purpose, permission can only be issued after a public consultation. Officials have figured out a way to avoid this situation for sometime – they issue work orders to cut trees in bunches of 49 or lesser. To cut fewer than 50 trees, only permission from the BBMP Tree Officer is needed, and nothing more.
Ipso facto, it's easy to circumvent categorization of projects in order to avoid public consultation.
The second major pitfall is the lack of transparency of public consultations. Public consultations are posted in some esoteric corner of the internet and is usually prefunctory.

"The Central Ministry has proposed a change in existing Environment Impact Assessment processes (EIA Notification, 2006) through a draft EIA Notification, 2020. The proposed notification will destroy the process of environmental protection and affecting the environment irreversibly, also making it easier for the corporates to get environmental clearances for their projects. Hence, We the people TAMILNADU, oppose the draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2020, and request you to withdraw the same.
It is evident from the fact that over 30 projects, located in some of India's most biodiverse forests have been urgently cleared or taken up for clearance in online meetings during the lockdown (April 23). Site inspections are a crucial component of project evaluation and are difficult during a pandemic. Ministry appears to be relying only on digital documents uploaded by the project developers. Even more surprisingly these projects have been cleared at a time when Covid-19 has revealed dramatically how seriously the loss of forest land and biodiversity can increase zoonotic diseases.
Environmentalists also have raised their voice and wrote to Environment Minister regarding how forest and environment clearances were being granted across India during the lockdown. On that note, shockingly, the Ministry has put out a draft notification for public comments amidst global economic and public health emergency when there is restricted public movement.
 The new amendment poses a serious threat to the environment and there are some areas of concern like granting post-facto clearances to Industries and leaving aside them with Fine alone in case of any violations. For several projects, the whole process of EIA is made simpler and fails to meet the standards of basic environmental protections. However, in an order on April 1, the Supreme Court held that ""ex post facto environmental clearances"" are contrary to law. It said: ""Environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development"".
A public hearing has been exempted to many industries (those producing acids, paints, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) located in Notified Industrial Zone, this will create serious problems in areas that depend entirely on ground and river water for agricultural usage. Public consultation has also been exempted from a list of linear projects. Projects such as roads and pipelines in border areas will not require any public hearing. The 'border area' is defined as ""area falling within 100 kilometers aerial distance from the Line of Actual Control with bordering countries of India."" That would cover much of the Northeast, the region with the country's richest biodiversity. Exemption from public hearing goes against International environmental law and agreements.
Increased validity of the environment clearance for mining projects and river valley projects from 30 years currently to 50 years and, 10 years currently to 15 years respectively, thus increasing the risk of irreversible environmental, social, and health consequences on account of the project remaining unnoticed for long.
Through the draft, it is enough for the industries to provide an annual environmental compliance report rather than half-yearly reports. Past experiences show that industries have continued to provide data that are false and inaccurate. Seeking an annual report provides an opportunity for the industries to further underestimate any socio-environmental issues arising in their projects.
 The Public consultation process is diluted. The period for the public to submit their views and responses during a public hearing for any application seeking Environment clearance has been reduced from 30 days to 20 days. It is aimed at denying the proper opportunity to record the objections of the people of the region. 
The various provisions of the draft are aimed at facilitating the government's doctrine of ""ease of doing business"". Hence, we would like to reiterate that it is our generation that will be a victim of the devastating effects of these twisted and diluted laws like the new EIA draft. In this age of high pollution levels in our cities, we need to strengthen the EIA 2006 instead of allowing amendments that will dilute the rules and encourage environmental violations.
 The EIA can be used to bring India out of the Covid-19 pandemic as an environmentally aware country through a green recovery that strengthens the role of environmental and social protection of all people and nature instead of justifying the present forms of harmful development.
So, we request you to kindly withdraw the Draft EIA Notification – 2020, right now",0,0,0
"Dear Mr. Mishra This is with reference to the draft EIA notification 2020 which was uploaded on the environment ministry's website om 12/03/2020. I raise my strong objection to the following points presented in the draft notification and request you to withdraw these notifications as it would have strong negative consequences for ecology and biodiversity of the country. 1. Point 7 on page 9 gave government total discretion on approving any kind of project which could very well be used by strong companies or mafia to create pressure on the government. 2. The list of exemptions mentioned in page 19 of the draft under the head public consultation gives exemption to virtually every project, for example the provision for relaxation given to companies for development in area with 100km aerial distance from LAC covers almost all of the north eastern states which is rich in biodiversity and these provision can cause serious damage to the environment. Not following Environment norms resulted in fire at the Baghjan well and these types of incidents will only rise if proper checks and measure isn't established. Roads are however important in development of northeastern states and i appreciate the initiative taken by government in this regard. 3. The concept of post facto clearence would give many industries a bypass to follow environment safety measures by paying a small fee and would act like a big blockage in the road towards sustainable development. This is also in direct contradiction to the order of supreme court dated 1st April 2020 stating POST FACTO CLEARENCE ARE CONTRARY TO LAW. 4. The inability of general public to register any kind if complaints and giving that power to only government and those that are currently involved in breaking the law would mean skipping an important step in keeping check and measures and would serve nothing but dire consequences for the environment and the ecology. 5. I raise strong objection to point 7 on page 9 which states that ""no information will be made public in regards to the decisions by the appraisal committee"" clearly is in violation to our right to information and a serious threat to the democratic fabric of our government. It is therefore my earnest request to make changes to the above mentioned provisions and reintroduce the draft after making necessary changes in the draft.",1,0,0
"The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the public consultation aspect. It provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.

- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful.
- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.
- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgments over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.
- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.

2. The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later. This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.
3. Loosened regulations: Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment.
4. Clearance exemption: If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations. In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife.
5. Fines in place of criminal implications: Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine.
6. No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wilife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal. It takes away the rights of vulnerable communities. If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.
In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them. In the wake of this pandemic, we should be more thoughtful and considerate about our environment .
Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.",0,0,0

Firstly, this draft proposes to shorten public hearings and exempt some large industries from public hearings itself- includes irrigation, dam works, etc. Marginalised communities who depend on the land for all their needs will can technically lose it without being consulted for 'strategic projects'.

Third,  Public hearing is no longer required ....this is against democracy, every decision that has to be taken regarding enviornment should include public hearing and a proper voting system to get a best decision.

"It is a well known fact that a significant roadblock for key infrastructure projects in India is the need for Environmental Clearances. For example, the Navi-Mumbai International Airport has been delayed for over a decade due to environmental clearance issues. Additionally, existing regulations make it cumbersome for project operators to obtain appropriate project financing, which make it even more difficult to accommodate concerns and issues raised by the appraisers. 
As per a Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation Report in October 2019 as many as 388 infrastructure projects (totalling over Rs. 4 lakh crore) had been hit by cost overruns of various reasons - environmental reasons being one of them.  Such delays and financing issues increase overall cost on projects and might even make them unviable. This leads to an increased burden on the government exchequer for infrastructure financing. While the draft EIA notification appears to make the process of obtaining EP or EC easier, it would be hugely beneficial if the environmental authorities allocated regulatory resources prioritizing overall project costs (including public and private expenditures). This would require better communication channels between the project financing authorities and the EIA authorities. 
Speaking of clearances, it's worth pointing out that govt employees responsible for conducting EIAs are also human, and there has to be a way for business owners to elevate concerns of improper behavior. Something like Karnataka's SAKALA would be useful here, which allows citizens to appeal when they are being stonewalled by someone looking for a bribe (for some govt departments, at least).
Another problem that may not have been remedied by this report is the categorization of the project. For example, Section 8 (3)(vii) of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, stipulates that if more than 50 trees need to be cut for any infrastructure purpose, permission can only be issued after a public consultation. Officials have figured out a way to avoid this situation – they issue work orders to cut trees in bunches of 49 or less. To cut fewer than 50 trees, only permission from the BBMP Tree Officer is needed, and nothing more.

Unless we solve the issue of proper public consulation, we'll be at the mercy of serendipity. An easy solution to this would be to allow the public to subscribe to a mailing list that can - most importantly! - be categorized and filtered by location etc, so that citizen engagement isn't eroded by information fatigue, along with informative flyers put up at the panchayat level for the full forty days of public consultation.",0,0,0

Then the issues come in with the post-facto clearance. Post facto approval will waive off the environmental damage which is already done by the project. Hazardous industries may use this loophole to start industries at any place.

"The Central Ministry has proposed a change in existing Environment Impact Assessment processes (EIA Notification, 2006) through a draft EIA Notification, 2020. The proposed notification will destroy the process of environmental protection and affecting the environment irreversibly, also making it easier for the corporates to get environmental clearances for their projects. Hence, We the people Tamilnadu, oppose the draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2020, and request you to withdraw the same.
Amidst the pandemic situation, it is improper to take decisions that will have an irreversible impact on the environment. However, the Union Ministry is keen on making changes in Environment rules and granting clearances. It is evident from the fact that over 30 projects, located in some of India's most biodiverse forests have been urgently cleared or taken up for clearance in online meetings during the lockdown (April 23). Site inspections are a crucial component of project evaluation and are difficult during a pandemic. Ministry appears to be relying only on digital documents uploaded by the project developers. Even more surprisingly these projects have been cleared at a time when Covid-19 has revealed dramatically how seriously the loss of forest land and biodiversity can increase zoonotic diseases.
Environmentalists also have raised their voice and wrote to Environment Minister regarding how forest and environment clearances were being granted across India during the lockdown. On that note, shockingly, the Ministry has put out a draft notification for public comments amidst global economic and public health emergency when there is restricted public movement.
Major Issues:
•    The new amendment poses a serious threat to the environment and there are some areas of concern like granting post-facto clearances to Industries and leaving aside them with Fine alone in case of any violations. For several projects, the whole process of EIA is made simpler and fails to meet the standards of basic environmental protections. However, in an order on April 1, the Supreme Court held that ""ex post facto environmental clearances"" are contrary to law. It said: ""Environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development"".
•    A public hearing has been exempted to many industries (those producing acids, paints, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) located in Notified Industrial Zone, this will create serious problems in areas that depend entirely on ground and river water for agricultural usage. Public consultation has also been exempted from a list of linear projects. Projects such as roads and pipelines in border areas will not require any public hearing. The 'border area' is defined as ""area falling within 100 kilometers aerial distance from the Line of Actual Control with bordering countries of India."" That would cover much of the Northeast, the region with the country's richest biodiversity. Exemption from public hearing goes against International environmental law and agreements.
•    Increased validity of the environment clearance for mining projects and river valley projects from 30 years currently to 50 years and, 10 years currently to 15 years respectively, thus increasing the risk of irreversible environmental, social, and health consequences on account of the project remaining unnoticed for long.
•    Through the draft, it is enough for the industries to provide an annual environmental compliance report rather than half-yearly reports. Past experiences show that industries have continued to provide data that are false and inaccurate. Seeking an annual report provides an opportunity for the industries to further underestimate any socio-environmental issues arising in their projects.
•    The Public consultation process is diluted. The period for the public to submit their views and responses during a public hearing for any application seeking Environment clearance has been reduced from 30 days to 20 days. It is aimed at denying the proper opportunity to record the objections of the people of the region. 
The various provisions of the draft are aimed at facilitating the government's doctrine of ""ease of doing business"". Hence, we would like to reiterate that it is our generation that will be a victim of the devastating effects of these twisted and diluted laws like the new EIA draft. In this age of high pollution levels in our cities, we need to strengthen the EIA 2006 instead of allowing amendments that will dilute the rules and encourage environmental violations.
The current draft lacks understanding of the adverse effects of activities like disturbances in eco-sensitive zones, extensive minings. The notification was released on 23rd March 2020, surprisingly right before the day of nationwide lockdown. There has been no wide publicity given to the same except being uploaded on the website. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a time to stay safe and protect oneself. Hence, the government must understand it is not the right time to make amendments in EIA Notification for its aspiration of doing business. We sincerely hope that the Environment Ministry will encourage informed public participation as committed through Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and the principle of Natural Justice. The EIA can be used to bring India out of the Covid-19 pandemic as an environmentally aware country through a green recovery that strengthens the role of environmental and social protection of all people and nature instead of justifying the present forms of harmful development.
So, we request you to kindly withdraw the Draft EIA Notification – 2020, right now.
Thanking you",0,0,0
"In and of itself, the consultation process should have retained the 45 days window. Can see no valid reason as to why that was shortened.
Firstly, the draft process mentions the various clearances that would be required and how it plans to segregate it into 'categories', as a citizen I would've liked it if there was a precedent and I knew where this was coming from - thus, an even greater need for public consultations.
Secondly, when one jumps into the weeds of the draft, they'll be drowned out by references and cross-references to a section after section which in the end makes the whole process incredibly cumbersome and difficult to understand.
In conclusion, the need for more conversation around our environment can't be stressed enough. However, as the recent episodes with the NGT show, we need to place a greater emphasis on the need for public consultation where the 'public' is part of the process from the get-go.",0,0,0

"One of the major problems with this report is the categorization of the project. For example, Section 8 (3)(vii) of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, stipulates that if more than 50 trees need to be cut for any infrastructure purpose, permission can only be issued after a public consultation. Officials have figured out a way to avoid this situation for sometime – they issue work orders to cut trees in bunches of 49 or lesser. To cut fewer than 50 trees, only permission from the BBMP Tree Officer is needed, and nothing more.
Ipso facto, it's easy to circumvent categorization of projects in order to avoid public consultation.
The second major pitfall is the lack of transparency of public consultations. Public consultations are posted in some esoteric corner of the internet and is usually prefunctory. We as a nation lack a cohesive public consultation space and hence most such consultations proceed with paltry inputs after they've been suspended in the void for a few days. Unless we solve the issue of proper public consulation, we'll be at the mercy of serendipity. An easy solution to this would be to post evey public consultation on a public forum like Twitter and to take strict action against any project which doesn't have a corresponding post on the twitter handle.

"Hello,
P1 - Monitoring frequency should be such that minimises the impact. A year's period will be a huge loss! This needs a 'rethink'!
P2- Public Consultation - The more the better. 45 should be an ideal if not less or more
P3 - Environmental Clearance - Decentralisation of power for clearances will anytime help speed up the process and minimize the red-tapism. Along with that, we should rethink around the categories we are issuing under A, B1 & B2. I quote from an article....""draft notification also stated that while projects concerning national defence and security or “involving other strategic considerations as determined by the Central government” would not be treated as category ‘A’, “no information relating to such projects shall be placed in public domain”. Such consideration will dissolve the purpose of assessing the impact on environment through such audits. 
P4 - Environmental Clearance Process - Each category of project should be strictly gone through appraisal process. If not, this will give an open opportunity for the big gainers to further deteriorate the operations in environmental terms. 
This stage sees the overall and detailed scrutiny of the final EIA report, which will have been presented to EAC or SEAC.

"It is a well known fact that a significant roadblock for key infrastructure projects in India is the Environmental Clearances. For example, the Navi-Mumbai International Airport has been delayed for over a decade due to environmental clearance issues. Environmental Clearances should not be viewed at as a “roadblock” to getting a project up and running. However, existing regulations make it cumbersome for project operators to obtain appropriate project financing, which make it even more difficult to accommodate concerns and issues raised by the appraisers. 
 
Such delays and financing issues increase overall cost burden on projects and make them unviable over a period of time. This further leads to increased burden on government exchequer on infrastructure financing. While the draft EIA notification appears to make the process of obtaining EP or EC easier, I feel it would be beneficial to include overall project costs (including public and private expenditures) in the categorization process. This would facilitate a greater link between the project financing authorities as well as EIA authorities. Project costing dimensions should be taken into consideration while categorizing overall risk profile of the project in consideration. As per a Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation Report in October 2019 as many as 388 infrastructure projects (totalling over Rs. 4 lakh crore had been hit by cost overruns of various reasons - environmental reasons being one of them). It is therefore imperative that project clearance and financing agencies/authorities take into account such measures that include overall costing of the project. This will reduce overall project financing burden.",1,0,0
