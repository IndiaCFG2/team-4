Among the many features which the KendoReact Dialogs deliver are:

* **Resizing**&mdash;You can resize the window to change its dimensions to better view a large content.
* **Dragging**&mdash;The window can be dragged across the page, to position it at a specific part of the page.
* **Keyboard navigation**&mdash;The Dialogs can be controlled by the keyboard.
* **Title and content**&mdash;You have full control over what is rendered in the dialogs title and content.
* [**Theme support**](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dialogs)&mdash;The KendoReact Dialogs, as well as all 80+ components in the KendoReact suite, are styled in three polished themes (Bootstrap, Material, and Default) and can be further customized to match your specific design guidelines.
